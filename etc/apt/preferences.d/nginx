# Purpose:
#
#   Grant nginx.org repo priority for nginx and nginx related packages over other repos (#5724).

# Allow the nginx.org repo to override all other repos for the nginx package by the pin-priority
# listed below. If some other repo should set a priority higher than this, that repo will win.
#Package: nginx

# Allow ALL packages from the nginx.org repo to take precendence over all packages from all other
# repos. This is with the mindset that we wish for this upstream nginx package provider to provider
# nginx packages and all related packages to that one (loadable modules, helper packages, etc.).
# If some other repo is configured with a greater pin-priority than this one, then that packages
# from that repo will take precedence over packages from this one. The idea is that we'll only be
# using specific packages from this repo and that this repo will not distribute "common" packages
# that are best sourced from Ubuntu or another upstream provider.
Package: *
Pin: origin nginx.org
Pin-Priority: 1001
