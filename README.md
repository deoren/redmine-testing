# redmine-testing

Test environment for latest Redmine trunk. Initial files sourced from the
[automated-tickets-dev](https://github.com/WhyAskWhy/automated-tickets-dev)
project.

The provided setup script installs necessary packages and then configures
a vanilla Redmine installation using upstream SVN trunk.

Once installed, the test Redmine installation is available from
http://localhost:80/. To login, use `admin` for the username and `admin`
for the password. You will then be prompted to change the password.
